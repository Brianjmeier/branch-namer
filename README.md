# Branch Namer

When it's time to start working on a new task, every dev at Amalgama makes branch names that follow our convention.
It's a simple task, but it can be simplified even more. So I built this Chrome extension to do so.

I hope that anyone who decides to give it a go finds it useful.

Anyone is more that welcome to collab!

## Installation instructions:

* Pull your version of choice
* Run `yarn build`
* Open Chrome and go to `More Tools / Extensions`
* Enable `Developer mode`
* Click `Load unpacked` and select the `dist` folder the build command created
